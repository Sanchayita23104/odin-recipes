    <p>Butter Naan is a popular Indian flatbread that is soft, fluffy, and flavored with butter. It's commonly served with various Indian dishes like curries, kebabs, or as a standalone snack. This delicious bread is cooked in a tandoor or oven, giving it a slightly charred and smoky flavor, while the generous application of butter enhances its richness and taste.</p><br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yogurt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>Extra flour for rolling</li>
        <li>Butter for brushing</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, yogurt, and melted butter. Pour in the activated yeast mixture. Knead everything together until you have a smooth and soft dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little more warm water, if too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li>First Rise: Once the dough is ready, cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Divide and Shape: After the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release the air. Divide the dough into equal-sized portions and shape them into balls.</li>
        <li>Roll Out the Naan: On a floured surface, take one dough ball and roll it out into a tear-shaped or round flatbread, about 1/4 inch thick. If needed, sprinkle some flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cooking: Preheat your oven to its highest setting (typically around 500°F or 260°C) or heat a tandoor if available. Place the rolled naan onto a baking sheet or directly onto the hot tandoor, and cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the naan puffs up and the bottom develops some brown spots.</li>
        <li>Butter Brushing: Once cooked, remove the naan from the oven or tandoor and immediately brush it generously with melted butter.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the butter naan hot, either as an accompaniment to your favorite Indian dishes or as a standalone snack. Enjoy the softness and the buttery flavor!</li>
        <li>Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls until all the naans are cooked.</li>
